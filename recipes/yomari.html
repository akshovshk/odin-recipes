            Let the jaggery melt. Keep stirring with a spoon continuously so that it does not burn.
            Add little milk and stir again for a minute.
            Pinch little melted jaggery between your fingers. If it sticks in your finger then it is ready for use otherwise keep stirring in the saucepan. 
            Once ready, pour it into a bowl and add fried sesame seeds.</li>

            Then dip your forefinger in warm water with ghee/oil and press down gradually to make a deeper/bigger hole to create a cavity.
            Add melted jaggery with sesame seeds to halfway and hold the mouth of the hole and then start closing the upper part of the cone using your forefinger and thumb. (see carousel image 5)
