    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pork</li>
        <li>Minced ginger root</li>
        <li>Garlic minced</li>
        <li>Green onion</li>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the pork, ginger, garlic, green onion, soy sauce, sesame oil, egg and cabbage. Stir until well mixed.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Place 1 heaping teaspoon of pork filling onto each wonton skin. Moisten edges with water and fold edges over to form a triangle shape. Roll edges slightly to seal in filling. Set dumplings aside on a lightly floured surface until ready to cook.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Arrange dumplings in a covered bamboo or metal steamer so they don't touch to prevent them from sticking together; steam for 15 minutes, or until pork is cooked through.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
